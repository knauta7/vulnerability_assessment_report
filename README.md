<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>

 <h2>Scenario</h2>
 You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.<br>
<br>
A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.<br><br>

<b>System Description</b><br>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.<br><br>
<b>Scope</b><br>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. <br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtInforcSaonWAExPyMM1pM4rjJSdO9j/view?usp=sharing">NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</a> is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.<br><br>
<b>Purpose</b><br>
The database server for this company is valuable to the business due to using the latest software systems for both Linux and its MySQL database management system. It is important for the business to secure the data on the server because the database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. Because the company has many employees that work remotely from locations all around the world, the server being disabled will greatly impact the company's business.<br><br>

<b>Approach</b><br>
The three threat sources listed above were considered the likely risks towards the company. With the database being opened to the public, a competitor to the company could possibly use the public database for their personal gain, which could damage the company moving forward. Having a lot of remote employees could add risk with one (or more) of the employees either purposely or accidentally exploiting private business information to the public. Lastly, an open public database leaves the company very vulnerable to possible threat actors implementing malicious software into the system.<br><br>

<b>Remediation Strategy</b><br>
One of the security controls that can remediate the risks would be to implement the principle of least privilege to the employees. This could prevent remote employees from accidentally leaking valuable or private company information. Another contol that could be implemented is providing a defense in depth throughout the database. With different layers of security added in the public database, this could at least mitigate the risk of a threat actor either using malicious software or a business competitor trying to obtain sensitive information.<br>
